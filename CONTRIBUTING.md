### Writing an Issue

1. Before you start, make sure that a similar issue has not been written yet. To do this, use the search that GitHub provides.
2. If you don't find any such issue, then start writing it based on the structure described below.
3. Make sure to label your issue with the following labels
   - Bug
   - Enhancement
   - Question
4. Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of extension will generally not be accepted. Unless the maintainer opens the issue themselves where you can discuss it.
